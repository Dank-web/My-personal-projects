    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
Rockstar North began to develop Grand Theft Auto V in 2008, around Grand Theft Auto IV's release.[35] The development team totalled more than 1,000 people,
including Rockstar North's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games' studios around the world.[36] The proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine
(RAGE) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities.[37] The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation
and rendering tasks.[38] Having become familiar with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware over time, Rockstar found they were able to push the consoles'
graphical capabilities further than in previous games.[39] Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than 
Â£170 million (US$265 million), which would make it the most expensive game ever made at that time.[40][l]
The open world was modelled on Southern California and Los Angeles,[42] and its design and in-game render constituted much of the game's early work.
[43] Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage.[39]
Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos's road networks.[44][45] To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles's demographic spread,
the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city.[37] The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.[46]
A fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series' core structure by giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one.
[43] The idea was first raised during Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible.[35] Having developed two Grand 
Theft Auto IV episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009, the team wanted to base Grand Theft Auto V around three simultaneously controlled protagonists.
[12] The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games (such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3), and designed it to improve 
upon their gameplay mechanics.[19][47] They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system[48] and reworked the driving mechanics to
correct Grand Theft Auto IV's awkward vehicle controls.[49]
After an audition process, Ned Luke, Shawn Fonteno and Steven Ogg were selected to portray Michael, Franklin and Trevor,
respectively.[34] Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology,[50] but dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles
was recorded in studios instead.[51] The game's original score was composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years.[52] Licensed music
provided by an in-game radio is also used.[53] The team licensed more than 241 tracks shared between fifteen radio stations, with an additional two stations providing talk
radio.[m] Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus' original work composed for the FlyLo FM radio station he hosts.[55]

<h2>Release</h2>
<p>
Rockstar Games announced the game on 25 October 2011.[56] They released its debut trailer one week later,[57] with an official press release acknowledging its setting.[58]
Journalists noted the widespread industry anticipation ignited by the announcement, which they owed to the series' cultural significance.[59][60][61] The game missed its 
original projected Q2 2013 release date, pushed back to 17 September to allow for further polishing.[62] To spur pre-order game sales, Rockstar collaborated with several 
retail outlets to make a special edition with extra in-game features.[63] They ran a
viral marketing strategy with a website for a fictional religious cult, "The Epsilon Program", that offered users the chance to feature in the game as members of the cult.[64]

on the PS4 version.

than the original versions.[65]
A re-release of the game was announced for PlayStation 4, Windows (PC), and Xbox One at E3 2014. This enhanced version feature,
an increased draw distance, finer texture details, denser traffic, upgraded weather effects, and new wildlife and vegetation.[65] It includes a new on-foot
first-person view option, which required the development team to overhaul the animation system to accommodate first-person gameplay.[4] The PlayStation 4 
and Xbox One versions were released on 18 November 2014.[66] The PC version, initially scheduled for simultaneous release with the console versions,[65] was delayed until 14 April 2015.[67] According to Rockstar, it required extra development time for "polish".
[68] The PC version is capable of 60 frames per second gameplay at 4K resolution, and the Rockstar Editor lets players capture and edit gameplay videos.[69]
Plans to develop single-player downloadable content (DLC) were later scrapped as the team focused resources on Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption 2.[70] After Grand Theft Auto V's source code reportedly leaked online on 24 December 2023, possibly originating
from members of Lapsus$,[71] dataminers found at least eight sets of single-player DLC were in development but cancelled, including a Liberty City expansion.[72]
A new version, commonly referred to as "Expanded & Enhanced", was announced in June 2020.[73] Released on 15 March 2022 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S,[74]
it features technical enhancements and performance updates.[73] A trailer released for the new version in September 2021 was met with negativity, becoming one of the
most-disliked videos on PlayStation's YouTube channel;[75] journalists noted that fans were frustrated by Rockstar's continued focus on the game instead of other projects
such as a new Grand Theft Auto game, as well as an lack of apparent new features demonstrated in the trailer.[76][77][78][79] The PC version received the enhancements
in a free update on 4 March 2025.[80]

<p>
Grand Theft Auto V received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 50 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version[105] 
and 58 reviews for the Xbox 360 version.[106] The game is Metacritic's fifth-highest rated, tied with several others.[117] Reviewers liked the multiple lead character 
formula,[109][113][118] heist mission design[119][120][121] and presentation,[16][115][122] but some did not agree on the quality of the story and characters.
[108][114][116][123] IGN called Grand Theft Auto V "one of the very best video games ever made",[113] and Play considered it "generation-defining" and "exceptional".[115]
Edge wrote that it is a "remarkable achievement" in open-world design and storytelling,[124] while The Daily Telegraph declared it a "colossal feat of technical 
engineering".[125] It became the second-ever western-developed game to be awarded a perfect score from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu, after The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim.[126]
CNET felt that the game encouraged players to engage with all three characters.[127] Edge found that switching players helped avoid long travel times to mission start points.
[118] Because of the switching mechanic, Game Informer noted that players are kept "in the thick of the action" during shootouts.[109] Eurogamer wrote that switching added a 
tactical element to shootouts as characters set up in strategic outposts would cause fewer "shooting gallery" situations than previous instalments.[108] IGN felt the switching 
feature gave players more choice in their approach and made missions less predictable.[113]

Giant Bomb considered the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical mission structure.[119] Eurogamer likened them to "blockbuster set-pieces",[108] 
and GameSpot cited the 1995 film Heat as a stylistic influence on their design.[111] Joystiq felt creativity and methodical approaches were encouraged.[114] Polygon 
 likened rapid character switching during heist missions to "film editing, with the player serving as editor, switching rapidly to the most interesting perspective 
 for any moment".[120] Computer and Video Games felt that overall mission design was more diverse than and lacked the escort errands of its predecessors.[121]

The player character with their back to the camera, and the sprawl of an urban city centre in front of them.
Los Santos, the city featured in the game's open world. Reviewers praised its design and similarity to Los Angeles.[16][108][128] The departure from Grand Theft Auto IV's
 Liberty City was well received.[113][122]
Edge praised the game's graphical fidelity and absence of load screens.[118] Play complimented the draw distances and weather and lighting systems.[115] In Eurogamer's 
view, the lighting system was the game's most significant advancement.[108] Official Xbox Magazine (OXM) thought that the game was "probably the Xbox 360's greatest technical 
achievement", and was surprised that the open world could render on the console.[123] Reviewers lauded the open-world design and its streamlining of Los Angeles's geography 
into a well-designed city space.[16][108] GameTrailers considered the Los Angeles emulation authentic and the open world "full of voice and personality".[128] IGN and 
PlayStation Official Magazine (OPM) made favourable comparisons between Los Santos and Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City.[113][122] OXM felt Los Santos surpassed the 
"grey and gritty" Liberty City.[123] Reviewers praised 
the world's satire of contemporary American culture[16][108][113][114][121]âOPM opined that "the scathing social commentary is, of course, present and correct".[122]

Destructoid called the sound design "impeccable" and praised the actors' performances, original soundtrack and licensed music use.[16] IGN and Giant Bomb commended 
the music selection and felt that the original score enhanced dramatic tension during missions.[113][119] GameSpot wrote that the score "lends missions more cinematic 
flavour".[111] Edge said that the licensed music enhanced the city's "already remarkable sense of space" and that the original score improved the atmosphere of the gameplay. 
They summarised the game as "a compendium of everything Rockstar has learnt about the power of game music in the past decade".[129]

Many reviewers found the land-based vehicles more responsive and easier to control than in previous games.[111][115][122][123][124] Game Informer explained that "cars have a 
proper sense of weight, while retaining the agility necessary for navigating through traffic at high speeds".[109] In addition to the vehicle handling, most reviewers noted 
the shooting mechanics were tighter than they had been in previous games,[109][111][113] but Destructoid felt that in spite of the improvements, auto-aim was "twitchy and 
unreliable" and cover mechanics "still come off as dated and unwieldy".[16] Some reviewers felt the game solved a persistent problem by adding mid-mission checkpoints.[108][113][125]

The story and charactersâparticularly Trevorâpolarised reviewers. Some found the narrative inferior to previous Rockstar games and cited Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead 
Redemption's plot strengths.[108][109][114][123] Others thought the protagonists' contrasting personalities tightened the narrative's pacing.[16][113][118][120] GamesRadar 
thought the game negated the story inconsistencies and muddled morality of previous series entries.[112] Trevor was considered a particularly "horrible, terrifying, psychotic 
human beingâand a terrific character" by GameSpot.[111] Eurogamer found Trevor "shallow and unconvincing", and that his eccentricities hurt the narrative and overshadowed 
Michael and Franklin's character development.[108] Joystiq faulted the protagonists' perceived lack of likability, as the conflict between Michael and Trevor grew into a 
"seemingly endless cycle".[114] The Escapist had difficulty connecting with the characters' emotions since they acted out of greed with no sense of morality and thus gave 
players little reason to support them.[116]</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto V's re-release, similarly, received critical acclaim. It is the highest-rated PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game on Metacritic alongside Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2,[143][144] and the second-highest rated PC game alongside several others.[145]

Game Informer considered the addition of first-person "another significant breakthrough for the series" in the vein of Grand Theft Auto III's shift to third-person from 
Grand Theft Auto's bird's-eye view.[137] GameSpot found that playing in first-person heightened the impact of Grand Theft Auto V's violence, which made him reflect on 
morality and character motivation more than before.[136] VideoGamer.com opined that players feel like inhabitants of the world, rather than "guns attached to a floating 
camera".[141] The first-person view, in IGN's opinion, aided immersion and created a "surprisingly different experience".[138] VideoGamer.com praised the "finer details" 
in first-person animations like camera 
lean when players take corners on motorcycles, or the navigational instruments in plane cockpits.[141] Reviewers found playing the game more difficult in first-person,
[136][138] but Game Informer preferred the challenge.[137]

GameSpot thought the improved graphics and spatial anti-aliasing made the open world "even more spectacular". They said that in first-person "everything looks bigger and 
more imposing".[136] IGN favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent 
frame rates.[138] They praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version.[146] VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so 
consistent it was "scarcely believable",[141] although GameSpot cited occasional frame rate dips.[136] They opined that the PC version let players "witness the full extent 
of Rockstar's admirable handiwork", but noted that it "retains evidence of its last-gen roots ... with simple geometry".[136] VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor's 
accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations and camera angle restrictions.[142] IGN appreciated the PC version's customisable controls,[146] and GameSpot felt 
that constant switching between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad was necessary for "the best experience".[136] PC Gamer called the game "the most beautiful, expansive and 
generous" of the series.[140]

On the game's multiplayer, IGN reported low player counts in matches, long wait times in lobbies, server disconnection and occasional crashes. "Because of that," they wrote, 
"I can't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone".[138] VideoGamer.com found online character progression streamlined by comparison with the original version.
 According to them, the "grind of just doing PvP until co-op Jobs arrive with regularity"[141] was lost, and newcomers would likely find multiplayer enjoyable and balanced. 
 However, they wrote of frequent server disconnection, especially during load screens.[141] GameSpot thought the online mode was fun but "still suffers from a lack of 
 direction" for its open-ended and frenetic gameplay.[136] Game Informer reported "minimal lag or issues in the expanded firefights and races".[137]

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series releases received tepid responses from critics, who questioned the value proposition of a new version of the ageing title. While the 
improved visual fidelity and quicker loading times were singled out for praise, reviewers generally found the core gameplay, storytelling and character models dated.
[147][148][149][150] Hardcore Gamer thought the lack of new content made the upgrade difficult to recommend to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players.[147] GamingBolt was 
apathetic towards the visual enhancements but praised the increased accessibility for Online newcomers.[148] Jeuxvideo.com thought the release offered the supreme console 
experience and highlighted the improved graphics and load times.[149] Push Square faulted the antiquated humour but thought the visual and technical enhancements gave the 
"sunny sandbox a new lease of life".[150]</p>
